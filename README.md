# Revenue Performance Dashboard Project Report

### Project Objective
To develop a dashboard that shows total revenue, regional and department contributions, client performance, and monthly trends, helping make better business decisions.

### Key Questions (KPIs) 
Total Revenue and Hours: What is the overall revenue and the total hours worked across all services?
Regional Revenue Contribution: How do different regions contribute to the total revenue?
Department Revenue Share: What percentage of total revenue is generated by each department?
Monthly Trends: How does revenue fluctuate month-over-month, and what are the percentage increases?

### Process
Data Extraction and Transformation:
Utilized SQL queries to extract revenue and performance data from services_data and branch_data.
Joined services_data with branch_data to associate revenue data with regions.
Revenue Breakdown:
Calculated total revenue and hours across all services.
Aggregated revenue contributions by region, department, and client.
Calculated revenue percentages for each department relative to overall revenue.
Monthly Revenue Trends:
Used SQL Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate month-over-month revenue and percentage changes using the LAG() window function.
Implemented CASE statements to handle scenarios where the previous monthâ€™s revenue is zero or null.
Insights Generation:
Generated rankings for regions, clients, and departments based on revenue to identify top performers.
